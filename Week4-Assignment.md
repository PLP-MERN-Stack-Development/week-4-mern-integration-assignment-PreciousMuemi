# 🔄 Week 4: Deep Dive into MERN Stack Integration

## 🚀 Objective
Build a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that demonstrates seamless integration between front-end and back-end components, including database operations, API communication, and state management.

## 📂 Tasks

### Task 1: Project Setup
- Set up a project with a clear directory structure for both client and server
- Configure MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- Set up Express.js server with necessary middleware
- Create a React front-end using Vite and configure proxy for API calls
- Implement environment variables for configuration management


## 🧪 Expected Outcome
- A fully functional MERN stack blog application
- Proper integration between MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
- Clean code organization with separation of concerns
- Responsive UI with good user experience
- Implementation of at least one advanced feature

## 🛠️ Setup
1. Make sure you have Node.js (v18+) and MongoDB installed
2. Clone the starter code repository
3. Install server dependencies:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
4. Install client dependencies:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
5. Set up environment variables as described in the `.env.example` files
6. Start the development servers:
   ```
   # In the server directory
   npm run dev
   
   # In the client directory
   npm run dev
   ```
